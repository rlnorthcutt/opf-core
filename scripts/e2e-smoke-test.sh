# e2e-smoke-test.sh - end-to-end smoke test for new-pack.sh, validate-pack.sh,
# install-pack.sh, and bump-pack-version.sh. Exercises the golden path plus
# the specific security/atomicity guarantees the spec and these scripts
# claim, entirely inside a throwaway temp directory.
#
# Usage: scripts/e2e-smoke-test.sh
#
# Prints PASS/FAIL per check and a summary at the end. Exits 0 if every
# check passed, 1 if any failed.
#
# What this does NOT cover: semgrep/gitleaks/shellcheck are not installed on
# most dev machines, so those checks silently degrade to NOTE/fallback paths
# here rather than actually running (this script reports which tools were
# and weren't available). To exercise the real scanner path, install them
# (or run scripts/ci-install-scanners.sh) and re-run this script. It also
# does not exercise the CI templates themselves (ci/pack-scan.gitlab-ci.yml,
# .github/workflows/scan.yml) - those need a real GitLab/GitHub run.
