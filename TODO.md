# TODO

Open work items for opf-core. The OPF v1 spec is frozen in `spec/`; this list tracks implementation and ecosystem work.

## Before relying on this for real use

- [ ] Dry-run the full lifecycle (create, install, update, downgrade) against one real skill/tool you use today, not just the synthetic packs `e2e-smoke-test.sh` creates, before pointing this at anything else.
- [ ] Dependency resolution (`pack-install` skill step 1) has never been exercised against a real multi-pack dependency graph; don't rely on it for packs that depend on each other until it has been (see the `pack-install` item below).
- [ ] There is no rollback history: a successful update deletes the previous version (`<pack>.old` is removed after the swap). "Rollback" today means keeping the old pack source yourself and reinstalling it with `--allow-downgrade`. Decide whether to keep versioned copies of anything you install before you need one.
- [x] Curated OPF ruleset added: `ci/semgrep-opf-rules.yml`, mapped to spec Section 7.2's categories with real ERROR/WARNING severity, registry-independent (works offline). It is now the CI-blocking gate in both templates and in `scripts/install-pack.sh`; the registry `auto` ruleset remains a separate, non-blocking, best-effort pass alongside it.
- [ ] The harness-integration layer doesn't exist yet in this repo: nothing here wires `install-pack.sh`/the `pack-install` skill into a real running harness (who calls it, where resolved config values are stored, how a human sees and approves an `install.sh` diff in an actual UI). Field data (2026-09-13): a harness with git-native skill auto-discovery and reset-on-update (e.g. `pi`) can satisfy this with zero OPF-specific harness code, since reset-on-update gives the locked-by-default guarantee more strongly than checksum auditing (see the host-layout doc's harness-integration case study). Still open generically for harnesses without that auto-discovery/reset behavior.

## Spec and docs

- [ ] Repo is currently under the personal `rlnorthcutt` GitHub account; move to the `omnideck-dev` org once the spec/tooling is stable, and update all references in the same pass: schema `$id` (`schema/v1/manifest.schema.json`, currently the placeholder `opf-core/opf-core`), the CI template defaults (`ci/pack-scan.gitlab-ci.yml` `OPF_CORE_REPO`, `.github/workflows/scan.yml` `opf-core-repo` input), AND the template's own CI callers (`templates/pack-z-template/.github/workflows/scan.yml`'s `uses:` and `templates/pack-z-template/.gitlab-ci.yml`'s `remote:`), which currently all default to `rlnorthcutt/opf-core`
- [ ] Mark `opf-plan-v2.md` and `pack-spec-v2.md` (older drafts in a separate artifacts folder) as superseded or delete them, so nobody implements from the wrong document
- [ ] Add a rationale/design-decisions appendix if adopters ask for the why behind choices (TOML rejection, no permissions block, etc.)

## Tooling (scripts/)

- [x] `validate-pack.sh`: schema validation via `jsonschema` is fully implemented when the library is present (not partial); `scripts/e2e-smoke-test.sh` now covers validate-pack.sh, new-pack.sh, and install-pack.sh end to end
- [x] `validate-pack.sh`: `scan.exclude` patterns are checked (warns when a pattern matches nothing, per spec)
- [ ] `new-pack.sh`: interactive mode (prompt for name/vendor/description/item kinds) in addition to flags (item kinds now have a flag, `--with tool,routine,...`; add the same as an interactive prompt when not passed)
- [x] Add `scripts/install-pack.sh`: a callable script that mechanically enforces validate -> stage -> scan -> approve -> resolve config -> install -> lock -> atomic swap, for harnesses without skill support. Single pack only; does not resolve dependency closures (see `skills/pack-install` for that).
- [x] Add `scripts/e2e-smoke-test.sh`: end-to-end regression suite for new-pack.sh/validate-pack.sh/install-pack.sh, run in CI via `.github/workflows/self-test.yml` both with and without real scanners installed
- [ ] Consider an `uninstall-pack.sh` (spec Section 11's minimum is "remove the folder", but a script could also run `uninstall.sh` with the right env and warn before touching `PACK_DATA_DIR`). Not yet covered by `e2e-smoke-test.sh`.
- [ ] Consider a single-binary CLI (go or python) once bash checks outgrow bash (per reference doc)
- [x] Add `scripts/bump-pack-version.sh`: deterministically bumps `manifest.json` version (major/minor/patch) and prepends a `CHANGELOG.md` entry; backs the `pack-release` skill. Covered by `scripts/e2e-smoke-test.sh`.

## Skills (skills/)

- [ ] `pack-install`: implement the full 9-step procedure robustly (currently a SKILL.md description; test against a real pack). The single-pack steps (validate/stage/scan/approve/install/lock/swap) now have a mechanical implementation in `scripts/install-pack.sh`; what's left here is mainly step 1, dependency-closure resolution, which the script deliberately does not do.
- [x] `create-pack`: the gitleaks secrets check with a grep fallback is wired (shared via `scripts/secret-patterns.sh`); the refuse-on-secret path is covered by `scripts/e2e-smoke-test.sh`
- [x] Added `pack-release`: the author-side skill for shipping a new version of an already-created pack (decides the semver bump from a plain-language description of the change, writes the changelog, validates, commits with confirmation) - written assuming a non-technical pack owner who doesn't know semver or git. Backed by `scripts/bump-pack-version.sh`. Named to avoid colliding with `pack-install`'s consumer-side "update" (installing a newer version into a harness).

## CI

- [x] Added `.github/workflows/self-test.yml`: runs `scripts/e2e-smoke-test.sh` against opf-core's own scripts on every push/PR, once degraded and once with real semgrep/gitleaks/shellcheck installed via `scripts/ci-install-scanners.sh`. This exercises the scripts for real but NOT the `scan.yml` reusable-workflow plumbing itself (see next item).
- [ ] Test `.github/workflows/scan.yml` as a reusable workflow from a real pack repo (`workflow_call` needs a caller). The template now ships that caller at `templates/pack-z-template/.github/workflows/scan.yml`; a pack scaffolded from the template and pushed to a real GitHub repo will exercise this.
- [x] Test `ci/pack-scan.gitlab-ci.yml` include in a GitLab project — field-validated (2026-09-13) on a private, single-org GitLab deployment: canonical include across all packs, cross-repo fetch of scanner + ruleset at a pinned ref via `CI_JOB_TOKEN` works. Their runners couldn't reach GitHub Releases for shellcheck/gitleaks (VPN-only infra); see the `ci-install-scanners.sh` fix below. Still open: scaffolding from the public `templates/pack-z-template/.gitlab-ci.yml` remote-include and pushing to a fresh GitLab project, since that deployment used a merged core+template repo, not the public topology.
- [ ] Decide whether scan runs on PRs and/or pushes; document the recommended wiring in the reference doc (`self-test.yml`'s `on: push` + `pull_request` is a reference example, but that's opf-core's own CI, not guidance for a consuming pack repo)

## Ecosystem

- [x] Create `pack-common` (per-org shared content) and a real pack or two to exercise the full flow — field-validated (2026-09-13) in a private single-org deployment: a shared-content repo (3 skills, 3 tools) plus domain packs, full create -> scaffold -> scan -> release flow exercised end to end with a 12-check CI self-test suite. That deployment used a variant topology (template folded into core, per the host-layout doc addition above), not the public three-repo split, so the public topology's flow is still open.
- [ ] Exercise the symlink pattern (create-pack move scenario) and the collision rule in practice. Explicitly NOT exercised by the 2026-09-13 field feedback: a single-vendor private deployment made both N/A, which is itself supporting evidence for documenting simpler topologies (see the host-layout doc's variant-topology addition).
- [ ] Publish the spec trio somewhere indexable (repo README, possibly a docs site later); registry stays independent per spec
- [x] Gather early-adopter feedback (two orgs already gave feedback rounds; more field data wanted) — a third round landed 2026-09-13 (a private, single-org GitLab/`pi` deployment); folded into the spec (plural entity dirs, skill-id grammar, rolling-release subsection, optional dependency `ref`, executable-type definition), schema, and tooling (curated semgrep ruleset, `ci-install-scanners.sh` apt fallback, `bump-pack-version.sh` changelog-format detection) in this pass. More field data still wanted.
- [x] Review the work/internal early implementation against the public spec and fold improvements back — see the 2026-09-13 feedback pass above; the harness-integration case study (`pi`'s git-native auto-discovery satisfying the locked-by-default guarantee with zero OPF-specific code) is now documented in the host-layout doc.

## Housekeeping

- [ ] Tag v1.0.0 of the schema/spec when frozen
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md and a code of conduct - the repo is now public, so this condition is met
- [ ] Consider GitHub Pages or a small docs site for the spec
