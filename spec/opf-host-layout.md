# Open Pack Format (OPF) v1: Host Layout and Distribution Topology

**Status:** Non-normative companion
**Format version:** OPF v1 (`pack_format: 1`)
**Scope:** A recommended profile for how a harness lays out packs on disk and how an adopting organization distributes supporting infrastructure. This document is NOT normative. The normative contract lives in `opf-spec-v1.md`. Omnideck follows this profile.

This companion doc carries two things that the spec deliberately keeps out of the normative contract: the recommended host layout profile (Section 1) and the recommended distribution topology (Section 2). A harness may adopt the spec without adopting this profile.

---

## 1. Host layout profile

This is a reference and suggestions doc, not a requirement. It is the profile Omnideck follows. A harness may adopt the spec without adopting any of these suggestions.

### 1.1 Two top-level roots

Two top-level roots: `~/packs/` (no dot: the user's own, browsable, git-friendly pack workspace) and `~/.packs-external/` (dot: hidden, locked, installed-from-elsewhere). The dot prefix signals that the contents are not yours to edit; the "packs" stem keeps the folder visually associated with `packs/`. The root/home of `~` may depend on whether the user is in a different workspace or project, but the structure is maintained relative to the home.

Layout organized by provenance tier:

```
<native-root>/
  artifacts/
    okf-app.html                      # standalone owned item, fully editable
  data/
    my-data/
  skills/
    quick-notes/
  tools/
  routines/
    pack-sync/
      routine.json

  packs/
    okf-kit/
      manifest.json
      artifacts/okf-app.html          # real files live here
      data/wiki/
      skills/okf-skill/

  .packs-external/
    acme/
      onboarding-kit/
        manifest.json
        artifacts/ data/ skills/ tools/ routines/
```

### 1.2 Folder conventions

Items live in named folders at a root (system root, project/workspace root, whatever the harness uses), for example `skills/quick-notes/`, `tools/pdf-convert/`. This is a good-practice suggestion, not part of the spec. The spec does not prescribe where standalone items live; a harness defines its own locations.

### 1.3 Provenance tiers

Two trust tiers:

- **Owned**: user-created items, editable in place. Standalone owned items live directly in their native per-type folder: no pack, no indirection, editable in place. The user (or their agent) is the update path.
- **External**: installed from elsewhere, locked/read-only for the consumer, under `~/.packs-external/<vendor>/<pack-name>/`. Updated only by the pack owner pushing new versions; consumers never edit in place. "Clone to customize" is the only path to Owned, landing as a standalone item in the native folder (or into an owned pack afterward, with materialize-and-symlink).

### 1.4 Symlink materialization

Symlinks are suggested in one specific situation: when a pack is created and existing items are moved into the pack folder. In that case the system/tool/script SHOULD leave a symlink at each item's old location pointing into the pack folder, so that existing references (paths in configs, routines, tools, user muscle memory) do not break.

This is a suggestion (SHOULD), not a requirement, and it applies only to that create-pack move situation. Harnesses that manage references differently, or have no per-type native locations, do not need symlinks at all.

Create Pack moves real files into `~/packs/<pack-name>/<type>/` and leaves a symlink at each old native location. The pack folder is self-contained from creation (ready to git-push or zip-export, the natural place for `git init`). Nothing referencing native paths breaks.

Back in the native tree, a symlink:

`<native-root>/artifacts/okf-app.html -> <native-root>/packs/okf-kit/artifacts/okf-app.html`

This assumes a filesystem where symlinks are reliable; any surface without reliable symlinks owns an alternative.

### 1.5 Symlink lifecycle

Symlink lifecycle is enforced at delete time, nowhere else, and only in the create-pack move situation above. Deleting an item deletes its symlink; deleting a pack deletes every member's symlink plus the pack folder. A dangling symlink is a bug. Out-of-band edits are the user's responsibility; no drift scanning (a filesystem-wide consistency check is separate scope).

### 1.6 Native-tree collision rule

When materializing an item into a native per-type location and the name already exists (from another pack or a standalone item), the harness MUST refuse and report, suggesting the namespaced form `<pack>-<item>`. It must never silently overwrite. This rule applies in the same create-pack move situation as the symlink suggestion.

### 1.7 External packs

External packs are never symlinked into the native tree; they live hidden under `~/.packs-external/<vendor>/<pack-name>/`, locked, and "clone to customize" is the only path to Owned.

### 1.8 Migration notes

If a harness previously stored runtime data inside the pack root, migrating to the mutable-state split (spec Section 4.2) means moving that data to the runtime data directory outside the pack root. This is a one-time, user-visible migration; the spec itself defines no migration machinery.

**Rename note.** The two-tier model replaces an earlier three-tier model. The External tier was formerly called "contrib"; the `~/.contrib/` folder is now suggested as `~/.packs-external/`. Existing installs under `~/.contrib/` can be moved to `~/.packs-external/` at the harness's discretion.

## 2. Distribution topology: core, common, template

OPF defines the pack format. Adopting organizations also need supporting infrastructure around packs: where the scan rules live, how a new pack is scaffolded, and where shared content is stored. This section defines a recommended three-repo topology for that infrastructure. It is a pattern, not a requirement: a single-harness user can keep everything in one repo and ignore the split. The three repos are opf-core, pack-common, and pack-z-template. Scope note: pack-common is per user or per organization, never global. There is no shared global content repo in this topology. opf-core is a public repo anyone can use or fork; adopters create their own pack-common and pack-* repos.

**Variant topology: template folded into core.** A single-org, single-VCS deployment (for example a private GitLab group with one vendor namespace) can merge opf-core and pack-z-template into one repo while keeping pack-common separate: the template lives at `templates/` inside the same repo that hosts the CI include and the scan rules. Since a CI `include:`/`uses:` resolves at pipeline-creation time regardless of which repo's `templates/` a pack was scaffolded from, "scaffold already wired to CI" stays atomic even with core and template merged. This sits between the single-repo case above (everything merged) and the full three-repo split; pick whichever point on that spectrum matches how many teams and VCS boundaries actually exist.

**Vendoring the spec.** An org on VPN-only or otherwise offline infrastructure, unable to rely on GitHub fetches at build or validate time, MAY vendor the spec and schema (`spec/`, `schema/`) into its own private core repo, with a short doc noting the sync procedure and preserving the Apache-2.0 attribution. This is a sanctioned adoption path, not a fork of the format: the org still tracks and re-syncs against upstream opf-core; it is not maintaining a divergent spec.

**Harness-integration case study.** The harness-integration layer (who calls `install-pack.sh`/the `pack-install` skill, where resolved config values are stored, how a human approves an `install.sh` diff) is deliberately unspecified by OPF, since it is harness-specific. A harness with git-native skill auto-discovery and reset-on-update behavior can satisfy the "locked by default" guarantee (Section 1.3) even more strongly than checksum auditing: if the harness always resets installed packs to the tracked git ref, a consumer cannot drift from what was published, with zero OPF-specific harness code required.

### 2.1 opf-core

The infrastructure repo. It is public and harness-agnostic so any adopter can use it directly or fork it. It holds the reusable pieces that every pack depends on. Contents:

- `docs/`: this plan document plus an operator runbook covering installing packs and responding to scan failures.
- `ci/`: reusable pipeline templates. `ci/pack-scan.gitlab-ci.yml` is a GitLab CI template; `.github/workflows/scan.yml` is the equivalent GitHub reusable workflow, called via `uses:` from a consuming pack's own workflow.
- `templates/`: canonical pack skeletons.
- `scripts/`: `new-pack.sh` scaffolds a new pack from pack-z-template (name, vendor, description, and item kinds via flags, including `--with tool,routine,agent,artifact`; prompts interactively for the description if it is omitted). `install-pack.sh` deterministically installs or updates a single pack (validate, stage, scan, approve, install, lock, atomic swap) - the scriptable, mechanically-enforced counterpart to the `pack-install` skill for harnesses that can run scripts but not skills. It does not resolve dependency closures (spec Section 4.5), which remains the skill's job. `bump-pack-version.sh` deterministically bumps a pack's `manifest.json` version (major/minor/patch) and prepends a `CHANGELOG.md` entry - the scriptable counterpart to the `pack-release` skill, which decides the bump size and changelog wording on the pack owner's behalf. `ci-install-scanners.sh` installs semgrep/gitleaks/shellcheck, shared by both CI templates so they can't silently drift to different tool versions. `secret-patterns.sh` and `pack-name-pattern.sh` are shared regexes sourced by the scripts above. `e2e-smoke-test.sh` is the end-to-end regression suite, run by `.github/workflows/self-test.yml` on every push/PR.
- `skills/`: the canonical operator skills `pack-install/`, `create-pack/`, and `pack-release/`. `pack-install` installs a pack (spec Section 8.1) - the consumer side. `create-pack` scaffolds a new pack and checks for secrets before creating it: it flags likely secrets (keys, tokens, passwords) in the pack contents and refuses to create a pack that contains them. `pack-release` is the author side: it ships a new version of a pack the user already owns, deciding the semver bump from a plain-language description of the change (never asking the owner to name a bump level or write changelog copy themselves), then validates and commits with confirmation - written for pack owners who are assumed not to know semver or git.
- `routines/`: scheduled task templates, each a subfolder with a `routine.json` descriptor, for example a nightly staleness check.

The key mechanism is that every pack's CI config is a two-line include of core's scan pipeline. On GitLab the include is `include: project: opf-core, file: ci/pack-scan.gitlab-ci.yml`. On GitHub the pack has one job that uses the opf-core reusable workflow. The rationale is explicit: scan rules are single-sourced. A new dangerous-pattern rule or a tool version bump is fixed once in core, and every pack inherits it on the next pipeline run. Without this, each pack carries its own copy of the scan config and the copies drift apart. This is the same pattern as shared CI templates in any organization, and it is deliberately not overkill: the scan config is the security surface, and a security surface must have exactly one source of truth. One GitHub constraint applies: reusable workflows must be public or in the same organization as the pack that uses them.

### 2.2 pack-common

The per-user or per-organization shared-content repo. It holds content that is reused across multiple packs. Contents: `skills/` (SKILL.md folders), shared `scripts/`, `data/` (with a `manifest.json` declaring it a data-only pack), and `templates/`. One rule is stated prominently: a skill, script, or dataset moves into common only when a second pack needs it. There is no speculative sharing. Duplicate once, then promote on second use. The rationale is that premature sharing creates coupling and review burden for content nobody else consumes yet. Packs depend on common via the manifest `dependencies` field, using a vendor, name, version range, and source url (spec Section 3.2, Section 3.5).

### 2.3 pack-z-template

The minimal skeleton repo used by `new-pack.sh`. Contents: a placeholder `manifest.json` (name, version, and `pack_format` are filled in by the scaffolder), `README.md`, `OWNERS`, `CHANGELOG.md`, the two-line CI include, one example skill folder (SKILL.md plus optional `scripts/`), an empty `data/` folder, and a `.gitignore` that includes `.opf-env` and `.opf-lock`. The rationale is that a new pack goes from proposal to CI-green in one command, with the scan pipeline already wired. The "z-" prefix is a naming convention so the template sorts last in repo listings; adopters may rename it.

### 2.4 Validator

The validator script (`scripts/validate-pack.sh` in opf-core) is the enforcement point for format consistency. It checks: `manifest.json` schema (required fields, semver, `pack_format`), directory layout (`artifacts/`, `data/`, `skills/` and so on, presence and placement), zip-slip-safe paths, the lifecycle script contract (executable bit, no surprising network use), `README.md` presence (a warning, not an error), `contents` against the actual folders (a warning, not an error), and secrets: if an `.opf-env` file exists it must be listed in `.gitignore`, and the scan flags likely secrets (keys, tokens, passwords). Exit codes are 0 for pass, 1 for error (CI-blocking), and 2 for warning. The same validator runs locally and in CI, so a pack that passes locally passes CI. The pack-install skill invokes the validator as its first step. Implementation note: start as a bash script calling `jsonschema` plus the available language tools from the opf-core scan profile (Section 2.6), then promote to a small CLI (python or go, single binary) once the checks outgrow bash.

### 2.5 Scan staging notes

The scan runs on the staged/incoming copy in a temporary location before it replaces the installed pack. Because install is atomic (spec Section 8.1), the staged copy is a temporary sibling directory, for example `<pack>.new`, and the scan runs there before any replacement. On failure the staging directory is removed and the old pack remains intact.

### 2.6 opf-core scan profile

This section is the companion to spec Section 7. It is non-normative: it recommends tooling and a graceful-degradation contract, while the normative guarantee (a deterministic, non-LLM scan runs before install; error blocks, warning flags, info records) lives in the spec.

**Graceful degradation contract.** Tools that are not installed are skipped (a `command -v` check) with a note in the scan report. The manifest-schema and zip-slip path checks are the floor and run with zero tools installed; they are the only checks that must always run. `semgrep` (if present) is the only cross-language requirement, and even it degrades gracefully. No specific tool is required to be installed. This graceful degradation is meant for install time on an arbitrary harness machine whose available tools cannot be predicted. It does NOT apply to opf-core's own CI templates (`ci/pack-scan.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/scan.yml`): those install `semgrep` and `gitleaks` themselves rather than silently skipping them, because they are meant to be the single-sourced security gate every pack's repo inherits, and a silent no-op there would be a much larger blind spot than on one developer's machine.

**CI scan templates MUST NOT execute content from the pack under scan; they parse, lint, and detect only.** `ci/pack-scan.gitlab-ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/scan.yml` run the validator, shellcheck, semgrep, and gitleaks against the pack's own files - all of which read and analyze pack content, none of which run it. This is a load-bearing property, not an incidental fact: a pack's `install.sh`, `tool.json` entry points, and any other executable content stay untrusted, unexecuted data to these pipelines. A future change that adds a "smoke-run the pack" step to either template would break this invariant and MUST NOT be merged without re-deriving the security posture from scratch.

**CI scanning and install-time scanning are complementary, not substitutes.** CI scanning (the opf-core CI templates, run in a pack's own repo) protects the pack repository: it catches a dangerous pattern or a leaked secret before a commit merges or a release ships. It does nothing for a consumer who installs a pack from a source that never ran that CI - a malicious fork, a contrib repo with no CI at all, a zip handed over directly. Consumer protection is entirely the install-time scan (`skills/pack-install` step 4, or `scripts/install-pack.sh`'s scan step), run on the machine doing the installing, independent of whatever the source repo's CI did or didn't do. A harness or org relying only on upstream CI passing is not actually protecting its own installs.

**Recommended tools.**

| Language | Lint / format | Typecheck | Security |
|---|---|---|---|
| shell | `shellcheck` (+ `shfmt` format check) | n/a | `shellcheck` severity rules |
| python | `ruff` (lint + format) | `mypy` | `bandit` or `semgrep` |
| go | `go vet` | `go vet` | `gosec`, `semgrep` |
| js/ts | `eslint` (+ `typescript-eslint`) | `tsc --noEmit` | `semgrep` |
| php | `php -l` (syntax) | `PHPStan` | `PHPStan` security rules |
| ruby | `rubocop` | n/a | `brakeman` |

`gitleaks` is the recommended secrets-detection tool for the scan. `semgrep` is the recommended cross-language engine for the dangerous-pattern checks in spec Section 7.1.
