# create-pack

Scaffold a new OPF pack from the template in `templates/pack-z-template/`.
The scaffolder (`scripts/new-pack.sh`) enforces a secrets gate: it scans the
new pack for likely secrets and refuses to create it if any are found. This
skill instructs the agent to run `new-pack.sh` and to handle a refusal.

## Working directory assumption

Skills may run with the `OPF_CORE` environment variable pointing at the
opf-core checkout. If `OPF_CORE` is set, locate `new-pack.sh` and
`validate-pack.sh` under `$OPF_CORE/scripts/`, and the template under
`$OPF_CORE/templates/pack-z-template/`. Otherwise, locate them relative to
this skill if it is bundled with opf-core (for example
`<opf-core>/scripts/new-pack.sh`). If neither is available, ask the user for
the opf-core checkout path.

This matters because opf-core is typically installed once and reused across
many packs: the checkout is rarely the current working directory when this
skill runs. The new pack itself is created in the CURRENT working directory
(`new-pack.sh` scaffolds `./<name>`, not a path relative to opf-core) - `cd`
to wherever the user keeps their packs before running the scaffolder, using
the opf-core paths above only to locate the tooling itself.

## Procedure

1. **Gather pack details from the user.** Ask for:
   - **name**: lowercase `[a-z0-9._-]`, 1-64 characters, no leading or
     trailing separator, and never `.` or `..`.
   - **vendor**: the publishing namespace.
   - **description**: a one-line summary.
   - **item kinds**: which items the pack will contain (skills, tools, data,
     routines, artifacts).
   - **owner(s)**: who maintains this pack (goes in `OWNERS`, one per line).
     If the user is unsure whether this should be a new pack, an addition to
     an existing one, or a dependency-only bundle pack, see
     `<opf-core>/spec/opf-pack-boundaries.md` before scaffolding - splitting
     later is more work than deciding well up front.

2. **Run the scaffolder.** From the directory where the new pack should be
   created, run `bash <opf-core>/scripts/new-pack.sh <name> [vendor] -d
   "<description>" [--with <kinds>]`, where `<kinds>` is a comma-separated
   list drawn from the item kinds the user selected in step 1 (`tool`,
   `routine`, `agent`, `artifact` - omit `skill` and `data`, which the
   template already provides). The script copies the template, substitutes
   placeholder tokens, creates a `.gitkeep`-tracked subfolder for each
   requested kind, and runs the secrets gate.

3. **Verify the requested subfolders exist.** Confirm the scaffolder created
   a subfolder for each item kind the user selected in step 1. If `--with`
   was omitted or a kind was missed, create the subfolder by hand with a
   `.gitkeep` placeholder so git tracks the empty folder.

4. **Fill the manifest and OWNERS.** Edit `manifest.json` to set `name`,
   `version` (`0.1.0`), `pack_format` (`1`), `description`, and `vendor`.
   The scaffolder already substitutes `name`, `vendor`, and `description`.
   Replace the placeholder text in `OWNERS` with the owner(s) gathered in
   step 1, one per line, keeping the list short (`opf-pack-boundaries.md`
   Section 2) - a pack that needs many names on `OWNERS` to function is
   usually a sign it should be split, not a sign to keep adding names.

5. **Handle the secrets gate.** `new-pack.sh` runs the secrets scan itself
   after scaffolding and before printing success. If it refuses (exit 1), do
   NOT bypass it. Tell the user which file and pattern matched, and stop.
   Only if the user explicitly accepts the risk may you re-run with
   `--allow-secrets`; print the loud warning the script emits.

6. **Point the user at the next steps.** Tell them to run
   `bash <opf-core>/scripts/validate-pack.sh <pack-dir>`. CI scanning is
   already wired up by the template - no separate step needed.

## Notes

- Secrets never go in a pack. The scan flags likely secrets, and `.opf-env`
  must be gitignored.
- The template's `.gitignore` already excludes `.opf-env`, `.opf-lock`, and
  `.env`. It also ships `.github/workflows/scan.yml` and `.gitlab-ci.yml`,
  both already wired to opf-core's scan template - a new pack is CI-green on
  first push with no configuration.
- The scaffolder refuses to create a pack that contains likely secrets unless
  `--allow-secrets` is passed at the user's explicit risk.

See `spec/opf-spec-v1.md` for the pack format and Section 7 for scanning, and `spec/opf-pack-boundaries.md` for pack sizing, ownership, and the bundle-pack pattern.
